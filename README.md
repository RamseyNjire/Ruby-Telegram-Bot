# TELEGRAM BOT


[![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/made-with-ruby.svg)](https://forthebadge.com)

> In this project, I build a Telegram bot that gives a bit of info about me and serves random quotes.

## Built With

- Ruby
- The Telegram Bot API

## How to Install
- First, you need to get a telegram account at [Telegram](https://web.telegram.org)
- Once you have an account, search for @BotFather, the Telegram bot-making wizard. This should open a chat with the BotFather.
- Now type '/newbot' and send to start a new bot and follow the instructions. The BotFather will ask you to choose a username and give you an API token. Keep this token secret. It can be used to control your bot.
- Fork this repo and clone to your local machine.
- Cd into the repo and create a file in the main directory called 'config.rb'
- Inside config.rb, type 'TELEGRAM_TOKEN_ID' and set it equal to the API token you got from the BotFather. Make sure the API token is in quotes to make it a string.

- Now the rest of the app should run. Go to your terminal, cd into the 'bin' directory of the repo, and enter the command 'ruby main.rb'

- The bot should run. If you search for your bot by its username in Telegram, it should be ready to receive commands. Of course, you can alter the messages in ramsey_bot.rb to something you prefer.
